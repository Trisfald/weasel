At its core, weasel is a customizable battle system for turn-based games.

#### The key objectives of this project are:

* Extremely customizable battle system
* Defining the combat's rules should be easy 
* Supporting undo/redo of battle events 
* Simple yet powerful interface to integrate with the rest of the game (graphics, AI, etc)
