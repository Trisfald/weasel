# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to weasel! We all wish to build a great framework together.

Following these guidelines will help the other developers to make the project grow, in a friendly environment.

Weasel is looking for all kind of contributions. Helping with the implementation or the design, writing documentation, tests and examples, are great ways to help the project. Using the library and providing your feedback is another great contribution.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities
* Every change should be covered by tests.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Where to start?

You are welcome to open an issue with our design ideas or proposals. Otherwise, you can pick up a task from the project board.

# Getting started

Please follow this format to submit your changes.
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project (rustfmt).
    * Open a pull request.

# How to report a bug

When filing an issue, try to answer these five questions:
1. What version of Rust are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

As first step, you should check the wiki to ensure that your idea is not already in the roadmap!\
Then, open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process

The maintainer looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. He shall review the code in the next few days.\
After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
